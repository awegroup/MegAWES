MegAWES is a Matlab/Simulink model of an airborne wind enrgy (AWE) system based on a tethered rigid wing that is operated in pumping cycles producing multiple megawatt of electricity. The framework is a further development of the graduation project of Dylan Eijkelhof which was jointly supervised by TU Delft, ETH Zurich and DTU [[1,2]](#References). The ultimate purpose is to provide a reference model of a megawatt-range AWE system and a computational framework to simulate its operation. The simulink framework includes the following model components:

* Pre-calculated look-up tables for aircraft's aerodynamic behaviour.
* Segmented tether with a single attachment point at the kite's centre of gravity.
* Choice between 3DoF point-mass  and 6DoF rigid-body dynamic solver.
* Aircraft controller for power generation flight controls and path tracking.
* Set-force controlled dynamic winch (based on [[3]](#References)).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the software and how to install them.

1. Install Matlab/Simulink R2019B and some extra packages (for instructions how te get matlab, click [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html)):

	```
	Matlab (version R2019B, 9.7)
	Simulink (version R2019B, 10.0)
	Curve Fitting Toolbox (version 3.5.10, only needed for 6DoF)
	Stateflow (version 10.1)
	DSP System Toolbox (version 9.9, only needed for tether test cases)
	```
	
2. Install Git and Git-lfs (for instructions how te get git and git-lfs, click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for git and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) for git-lfs). Without git-lfs the libraries might not clone properly (note: other methods might also work).
3. After installation of git-lfs run the following command in a terminal (Unix, MacOS)/command(Windows) window:

	```
	git lfs install
	```

### Installing

1. Do not forget to check if the [previously mentioned software](#Prerequisites) is installed.
2. Get a copy of the latest `MegAWES` environment release:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/awegroup/MegAWES.git
	```

## Deployment

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running, tested on macOS 11.2.3

1. The following file allows you to run a full simulation until power cycle convergence of the current aircraft.

	```
	Run_OneSimulation.m
	```
	
	Two important parameters are set here:
	
	```
	Kite_DOF: Kite degrees of freedom, 3 (point-mass) or 6 (rigid-body)
	windspeed: Maximum wind speed of the wind shear profile, occurs at 250m altitude and above,
		3DoF: Always forced to 22m/s
		6DoF: 8m/s, 10m/s, 14m/s, 16m/s, 18m/s, 20m/s, 22m/s, 25m/s, 28m/s, 30m/s
	```

2. All input variables are set in:

	```
	Src/Common/Get_simulation_params.m
	```
		
	where base variables are set in:
	
	```
	Src/Common/initAllSimParams_DE2019.m
	```
	
	Following parameters are set:
	1. Aircraft is loaded from the `DE2019_params.mat` file.
	2. Environment parameters
	3. Steady base windspeed, 6m altitude (no turbulence is included at this stage).
	4. Simulation initialisation parameters
	5. Simulation constraints
	6. Tether characteristics
	7. Winch characteristics
	8. Flight path shape
	9. Tether force set-point (tracking)
	10. Controller gains
	11. Initialisation phase (loiter)

3. In the simulink models for both 3 and 6 DoF, the output parameters are defined in block:

	```
	RequirementModelsAndLogging
	```

	An example of the visualisation of the output is given in the main file `Run_OneSimulation.m` at the bottom.
	There the continuous power throughout the cycle is plotted, and a visual of the flight path is plotted in a 3D environment with colour coding the power production. 
	
	Also an example is provided on how to visualise the converged power pumping cycle as an animation.

4. Required libraries are found in the `Lib` folder and the source code can be found in the `Src` folder which are divided up between code required for 3DoF, 6DoF or both simulations. A more detailed description of the files and folders is given in [File structure & Description](#file-structure-and-descriptions). Rapp [4] gives a more detailed explanation of the controller strategy and reference frames used throughout this framework.
