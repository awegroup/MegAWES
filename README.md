MegAWES is a Matlab&reg;/Simulink&reg; model of an airborne wind energy (AWE) system based on a tethered fixed-wing that is operated in pumping cycles producing multiple megawatts of electricity. The framework is a further development of Dylan Eijkelhof's graduation project, which was jointly supervised by TU Delft, ETH Zurich, and DTU [[1,2]](references). The ultimate purpose is to provide several reference models of (sub)megawatt-AWE systems and a computational framework to dynamically simulate its operation. The Simulink framework includes the following model components:

* Pre-calculated look-up tables for aircraft's aerodynamic behaviour.
* Segmented tether with a single attachment point at the kite's centre of gravity.
* Choice between 3DoF point-mass  and 6DoF rigid-body dynamic solver.
* Modified L0 Aircraft controller for power generation flight controls and path tracking.
* Different flight patterns possible: circle, figure-of-eight up-loop and down-loops.
* Optimal (quasi-steady) tether force controlled dynamic winch for traction phase (based on [[3]](#references)).
* Set-force controlled dynamic winch for retraction phase (based on [[4]](#references)).

## ‚öôÔ∏èGetting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the software and how to install them.

1. Install Matlab/Simulink R2023a and some extra packages (for instructions how te get matlab, click [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html)):
   
   ```
   Matlab
   Simulink
   Curve Fitting Toolbox
   Stateflow
   DSP System Toolbox
   Aerospace Toolbox
   Aerospace Blockset
   ```

2. Install **Git** and **Git-lfs** (for instructions on how to get git and git-lfs, click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for git and [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) for git-lfs). Without git-lfs the libraries might not clone properly (note: other methods might also work).

3. After installation of **git-lfs** run the following command in a terminal (Unix, MacOS)/command window (Windows):
   
   ```
   git lfs install
   ```

### Installing

1. Do not forget to check if the [previously mentioned software](#prerequisites) is installed.

2. Get a copy of the latest `MegAWES` environment release:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/awegroup/MegAWES.git
   ```

## üí™Deployment

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running, tested on macOS 14.6.1

1. The following file allows you to run a full simulation until power cycle convergence of the current aircraft.
   
   ```
   runMain.m
   ```
   
   The input parameters are set in Lib/[pattern]_simInput.yaml, the pattern here links to the demo files showing how to set-up the specific pattern in the pathparam (struct) variable.

2. All input variables are set in:
   
   ```
   Lib/[pattern]_simInput.yaml
   ```
   
    where the kite specific variable are set in:
   
   ```
   Lib/MegAWESkite.yaml
   ```
   
    Following parameters are set:
   
   1. **ENVMT**: Environment parameters, steady max windspeed (no turbulence is included at this stage).
   2. **simInit**: Simulation initialisation parameters.
   3. **actuatorLimit**: Actuator constraints.
   4. **tetherParams**: Tether characteristics.
   5. **winchParameter**: Winch characteristics.
   6. **pathparam**: Flight path shape.
   7. **controllerGains_traction**: Controller gains (traction).
   8. **controllerGains_retraction**: Controller gains (retraction).

3. In the simulink models for both 3 and 6 DoF, the output parameters are defined in the root of the simulink model on the right side
   
   An example of the visualisation of the output is given in `demoPlot.m`.
   There the continuous power throughout the cycle is plotted, and a visual of the flight path is plotted in a 3D environment with colour coding the power production.

4. Required libraries are found in the `Lib` folder and the source code can be found in the `Src` folder. Eijkelhof [[5]](#references) gives a more detailed explanation of the controller strategy and reference frames used throughout this framework.
